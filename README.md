# Personal API

## Introduction

This repository contains my Personal API, which outlines my preferred ways of working, communication styles, and expectations for collaboration. This document serves as a user manual for teammates and collaborators to understand how to engage with me effectively.

## Personal API

### Preferred Way of Working

Describes how I prefer to work (e.g., independently, collaboratively in teams, etc.).

ðŸ˜„ Remotely. In the office once per week, usually on Tuesdays. 

### Preferred Working Hours

Specifies my typical work hours or the times when I am most productive.

ðŸ˜„ 10AM - 6PM. I have several blocks of focus time during these hrs that you cannot book.

### Preferred Way to Meet

Indicates my preferred methods of communication and meeting (e.g., email, chat, video calls, in-person).

ðŸ˜„ I love Slack.
ðŸ˜„ I hate emails.

ðŸ˜„ I am ok with async conversations in Slack. I usually get to all conversations, topics and threads before the end of each work day.

ðŸ˜„ I don't mind meeting virtually. My calendar is organized and there are a few available spots open for meetings.

ðŸ˜„ When I go into the office, my calendar stays clear. Only in-person meeting invites I will allow for Tuesdays.

### Preferred Period for Interrupts

Specifies times when I am most open to interruptions or quick questions.

ðŸ˜„ Probably first thing in the morning. Before my teams huddle at 11.30AM EST.

### Handling Interrupts

Describes how interruptions should be managed (e.g., urgent matters via phone, non-urgent via email).

ðŸ˜„ I will take them as they come. 

ðŸ˜„ I prefer Slack. Tag me. Approach me via #pod-sre or if necessary via DM. Escalate via DM in Slack and if its super urgent use Pagerduty.

### Minimum Information Expectation

States the minimum amount of information or context I expect others to provide when they approach me.

ðŸ˜„ I expect you come prepared. Why do we meet? Could this conversation be had asynchronously? What do you expect from me? i.e. sounding board, a direction or guidance, a decision, for me to take an action etc.

### Preference for Conversations

States whether I prefer public (group) conversations or private (one-on-one) discussions.

ðŸ˜„ I prefer public conversations for transparency and as I see every conversation as a learning and sharing opportunity. 

### Openness to Regular 1-1s

Indicates if I am open to regular one-on-one meetings and how often (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly).

ðŸ˜„ I am open. How regularly we meet will depend on a few factors we can discuss.
