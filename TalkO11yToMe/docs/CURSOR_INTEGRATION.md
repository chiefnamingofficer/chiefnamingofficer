# Cursor IDE Integration Guide

Transform your development workflow with AI-powered observability using TalkO11yToMe and Cursor IDE.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **1. Project Setup in Cursor**

```bash
# Open TalkO11yToMe in Cursor
cursor /path/to/TalkO11yToMe

# Ensure environment is configured
cp env/env.template env/.env.dev
# Edit .env.dev with your Dynatrace credentials
```

### **2. Essential First Steps**
1. **Index the codebase**: Let Cursor understand your tools and documentation
2. **Test connectivity**: Run a quick health check
3. **Configure environment**: Set up your Dynatrace environment type
4. **Learn the workflow**: Start with basic AI analysis

## üß† AI-Powered Development Workflows

### **Morning Standup Routine**

**Cursor AI Prompt:**
```
I'm starting my day. Please run our Dynatrace monitoring dashboard and give me:

1. Current system health status
2. Any overnight issues that need attention
3. Top 3 priorities for today based on the data
4. Any Lambda functions showing degraded performance

Run: node tools/dynatrace-monitor.js
```

**Expected AI Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Execute monitoring dashboard
- ‚úÖ Analyze results with visual formatting
- ‚úÖ Prioritize issues by severity and business impact
- ‚úÖ Provide actionable recommendations

### **Pre-Deployment Health Check**

**Cursor AI Prompt:**
```
I'm about to deploy changes to [service-name]. Please:

1. Check current health of related services
2. Look for any existing problems that might interfere
3. Analyze recent performance trends
4. Give me a go/no-go recommendation

Focus on: [specific-lambda-functions or services]

Run: node tools/grail-log-query.js "service-name" now-2h
Run: node tools/dynatrace-monitor.js
```

### **Incident Response Workflow**

**When an alert comes in:**
```
üö® INCIDENT: [Brief description]

Please help me investigate:

1. Run comprehensive problem analysis
2. Identify root cause indicators
3. Check for related Lambda function errors
4. Suggest immediate remediation steps
5. Create an action plan

Start with: node tools/grail-log-query.js "error" now-1h
Then: node tools/classic-api-client.js problems 20
```

### **Performance Debugging Session**

**When performance issues arise:**
```
I'm debugging slow response times in [service-name]. Please:

1. Analyze recent performance data
2. Look for Lambda timeout issues
3. Check for database connection problems
4. Identify performance bottlenecks
5. Suggest optimization strategies

Commands:
node tools/grail-log-query.js "timeout" now-4h
node tools/classic-api-client.js lambda-problems now-12h
```

## üéØ Advanced AI Analysis Patterns

### **Root Cause Analysis Pattern**

**Multi-Step Investigation:**
```
STEP 1: Get the overview
"Run node tools/dynatrace-monitor.js and summarize the current state"

STEP 2: Deep dive into problems
"Run node tools/classic-api-client.js problems 25 and categorize by service impact"

STEP 3: Analyze specific services
"Run node tools/grail-log-query.js '[service-name]' now-6h and look for patterns"

STEP 4: Generate recommendations
"Based on all this data, create a comprehensive incident response plan"
```

### **Security Analysis Pattern**

**Vulnerability Assessment:**
```
SECURITY REVIEW: Please analyze our environment for security concerns:

1. Check for authentication failures
2. Look for suspicious Lambda function errors
3. Identify potential security vulnerabilities
4. Review access patterns and anomalies
5. Create a security action plan

Commands:
node tools/grail-log-query.js "auth" now-24h
node tools/grail-log-query.js "unauthorized" now-24h
node tools/classic-api-client.js problems 50
```

### **Capacity Planning Pattern**

**Performance Trending:**
```
CAPACITY PLANNING: Help me understand our resource utilization:

1. Analyze Lambda function performance trends
2. Identify scaling bottlenecks
3. Look for resource exhaustion patterns
4. Predict future capacity needs
5. Recommend infrastructure improvements

Run multiple time ranges:
node tools/grail-log-query.js "high load" now-7d
node tools/classic-api-client.js lambda-problems now-7d
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Cursor-Specific Best Practices

### **1. Environment Management**

**Use Cursor's environment variable support:**
```bash
# In Cursor terminal
export $(cat env/.env.dev | xargs)
echo $DT_ENVIRONMENT  # Verify environment is loaded
```

**Environment switching:**
```bash
# Quick environment switching
alias dt-dev="export $(cat env/.env.dev | xargs)"
alias dt-prod="export $(cat env/.env.prod | xargs)"
```

### **2. Efficient Prompt Patterns**

**Template for Structured Analysis:**
```

```

### **3. Code Integration Workflows**

**Pre-Commit Health Check:**
```
Before I commit these changes, please check if they might impact:

1. Services we're modifying: [list services]
2. Current system health
3. Any ongoing incidents
4. Recent performance trends

Run: node tools/dynatrace-monitor.js
Then: node tools/grail-log-query.js "[service-keywords]" now-2h

Give me a commit readiness assessment.
```

**Post-Deploy Verification:**
```
I just deployed [changes]. Please monitor and verify:

1. No new errors introduced
2. Performance metrics remain stable
3. No increase in problem frequency
4. All related services functioning normally

Monitor for 15 minutes, then give me a deployment success report.

Use: node tools/dynatrace-monitor.js (run now and in 15 minutes)
```
