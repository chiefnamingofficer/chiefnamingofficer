# Cursor MCP Demo: AI-Powered Dynatrace Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Simulating MCP with Cursor

Since the official MCP server requires complex OAuth setup, let's use **Cursor's AI** with your **working tools** to demonstrate MCP concepts.

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Demo

### Step 1: Basic Health Check via AI

**In Cursor AI Chat, try this prompt:**

```
I need you to help me analyze my Dynatrace environment. Please run this command and explain the results:

node tools/dynatrace-query.js

Then categorize the problems by severity and suggest which ones need immediate attention.
```

### Step 2: Security Analysis 

**Follow up with:**

```
Based on the Lambda function errors you see, what security implications should I be concerned about? Focus on:
- compassdigital-service-ws-v1-wsConnect (WebSocket issues)
- cdl-email-dev-cdl_order_issue (Email processing)
- dev-eventforwarder (Event forwarding)

Create an incident response priority list.
```

### Step 3: Deep Dive Analysis

**Ask Cursor to run specific queries:**

```
Please run this command to get more details about a specific problem:

node tools/dynatrace-oauth-tool.js --use-api-token --detailed-analysis

Then explain what each metric means and create a monitoring dashboard recommendation.
```

### Step 4: Monitoring Strategy

**Request strategic analysis:**

```
Based on the 15+ problems in our environment, help me:
1. Create automated alert rules
2. Design a monitoring dashboard
3. Set up escalation procedures
4. Plan capacity improvements
```

## ðŸ§  This Demonstrates MCP Concepts

**What's happening here:**
1. **Host (You)** â†’ Ask questions through Cursor AI
2. **MCP-like Bridge (Cursor)** â†’ Understands your tools and runs them
3. **Business Tool (Dynatrace API)** â†’ Returns data via your scripts
4. **AI Analysis (Cursor)** â†’ Interprets results and provides insights

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

Cursor should:
- âœ… Run your Dynatrace tools successfully
- âœ… Analyze the JSON responses intelligently  
- âœ… Provide actionable insights
- âœ… Suggest monitoring improvements
- âœ… Create incident response plans

## ðŸš€ Advanced Prompts to Try

```
"Create a comprehensive security assessment of our Lambda functions based on the Dynatrace data"

"Generate a weekly infrastructure health report using our monitoring data"

"Design an automated remediation workflow for the top 5 recurring problems"

"Build a cost optimization plan based on the performance issues you see"
```

**ðŸŽ‰ Outcome**: You'll experience MCP-like AI-powered observability analysis using your working tools, demonstrating the value of the MCP architecture without the OAuth complexity!
